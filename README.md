## Definitions

### Non-fungible

By being *fungible* an item or its parts can be exchanged for something of the same species at equivalency. A *fungible* item is not unique. For example a dollar is fungibnle because it is not unqique and can be traded for another dollar because they have equal value.

In contrast, a non-fungible asset is unique and does not have the same value as another non-fungible item. For example, a Picasso's painting is not the same as a Goya despite of being both paintings and from Spanish artists. Both are non-fungible: unique and different value.

### Token

In the context of crypto, a token is a piece of data stored in a pubic ledger called blockchain. It is used to represent fungible and non-fungible assets. Sometimes *token* is used to refer to other crypto currencies besides Bitcoin or Ether, which are the two largest.

There are several categories of tokens:

### Non-fungible Token (NFT)

NFTs are tokens that represent non-fungible digital assets, such as images, music and even virtual real estate. As all tokens, they are stored in a blockchain. The largest blockchain to store NFTs is Ethereum, which is also used to store the cryptocurrency called Ether.

### DeFi Tokens

*DeFi* refers to "Decentralized Finance. "Tokens designed to reproduce traditional financial functions (i.e. lending, saving, trading, insurance.) Its main goal is to eliminate middlemen –such as banks– and enable direct transactions between two or more parties. DeFi Tokens are issued by applications built on top of smart contract blockchains like Ethereum. This means that each application has its own token. They enable rewards to users performing a particular action. In turn, they can use their reward tokens to exert their vote in future modifications.

Despite their advantages and increasing popularity, DeFi Tokens are a high-risk investment due to their volatility.
