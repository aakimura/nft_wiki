## Definitions

### Non-fungible

By being *fungible* an item or its parts can be exchanged for something of the same species at equivalency. A *fungible* item is not unique. For example a dollar is fungibnle because it is not unqique and can be traded for another dollar because they have equal value.

In contrast, a non-fungible asset is unique and does not have the same value as another non-fungible item. For example, a Picasso's painting is not the same as a Goya despite of being both paintings and from Spanish artists. Both are non-fungible: unique and different value.

### Token

In the context of crypto, a token is a piece of data stored in a pubic ledger called blockchain. It is used to represent fungible and non-fungible assets. Sometimes *token* is used to refer to other crypto currencies besides Bitcoin or Ether, which are the two largest.

There are several categories of tokens: 
| Category | Description | Examples
| --- | --- | ---|
| DeFi tokens | Tokens designed to reproduce traditional financial functions but with the ability of enabling direct transactions between two or more people | [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/), [LUNA](https://www.terra.money/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Aave](https://aave.com/)
| Governance tokens | A special kind of DeFi token that function as "votes" in the future of a protocol or app. The more tokens, the more votes you get. Governance tokens are essential in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that –as their name says– do not have a centralized leadership. | [COMP](https://compound.finance/), [MKR](https://makerdao.com/en/)
| Non-fungible tokens | Tokens that represent ownership right to a unique digital o real-life asset. | [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/), [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)
| Security tokens | Tokens aimed to be the crypto equivalent to traditional securities like stocks or bonds. Its main purpose is to remove brokers from trading securities.

### Non-fungible Token (NFT)

NFTs are tokens that represent non-fungible digital assets, such as images, music and even virtual real estate. As all tokens, they are stored in a blockchain. The largest blockchain to store NFTs is Ethereum, which is also used to store the cryptocurrency called Ether.

### DeFi Tokens

*DeFi* refers to "Decentralized Finance. "Tokens designed to reproduce traditional financial functions (i.e. lending, saving, trading, insurance.) Its main goal is to eliminate middlemen –such as banks– and enable direct transactions between two or more parties. DeFi Tokens are issued by applications built on top of smart contract blockchains like Ethereum. This means that each application has its own token. They enable rewards to users performing a particular action. In turn, they can use their reward tokens to exert their vote in future modifications.

Despite their advantages and increasing popularity, DeFi Tokens are a high-risk investment due to their volatility.

### Governance Tokens

Tokens that give token holders votes in decisions regarding the future of a protocol or app. Governance tokens function just as a traditional board, where shareholders propose motions and then they are voted. Similarly, the more the tokens, the more votes a holder has. The organizations that allow this kind of democratization are called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO).

The relationship among token holders, as well as with the organization is governed by smart contracts on Ethereum's blockchain.
